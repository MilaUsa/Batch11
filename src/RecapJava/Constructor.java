    /*
    1. What is constructor and what do you do with it?
    constructor is a way to initialize the instance variables.
    Assign the values to the new object

    2. Can you tell me the difference between constructor and method?
    -does not have return type
    -must have same name as a class name

    3. Can you make the constructor private?
    SIR/MADAM you can not make the constructor not only  private also static and Final and Abstract.
    ***** but in my testing i am using singleton patter design which is a special class that limit people to access your data

    4.What is the difference between this, this(),super,super();
    this keyword: this means refers to instance variables and methods
    this()--> To call another constructor in the same class
    -it has to be in the first line of the code.

    super--> means refers to parent instance variables and methods
    super()--> to call the constructor from parent class
